*Try to clear this everyday when it's done!*

In theory if I work these days I can get about 20-30 hours a week... Not that much, barely as much as a part time job,
however if I do some quality work it is possible I can actually push for a late September Act 1 release.

Since most of the work is at the early stages (in producing Act1, I would've done a good portion of the content phase), the
other acts are going to do asset reuse to avoid the time slog. The idea is we seek a *full* release in November or December.

We are probably starting another project concurrently by the Act1 deadline, since I would be bored if this was all I did, also
I wouldn't be able to learn anything lmao.

* General Plot Outline
This was the original brainstorming list of stuff that I wanted to revise the story as, and this
looks like it's okay.

- Former Ruler makes pact with devil for power, gets tricked and stripped of everything,
- Given a magical sword that has hidden abilities
- Ruler fights as a mercenary as the devil slowly destroys his nation
- Local lords(kind of tyrants) who had been previously conspiring, take opportunities to seize and hold certain areas around the nation
- Former Ruler has traveled far from his lands as he had been exiled, and now he tries to return for his throne

* Tasks by Days of the Week
** Monday
** Tuesday
None.
** Wednesday
None this week.
** Thursday
Some of these goals are basically to finish off the main game loop, and theoretically put it into the
content / polish stage. Mostly content first and some polish after. But we are very close to completing the core
game loop. We should ideally be able to do it by that week but it's entirely possible I just can't accomplish that.

Who knows.
*** TODO Fade out cutscene power
Using for dreamy fade out sequences.

(Screenshot the current framebuffer, then let it fade out into the new scene).
Not very difficult and is a cheap effect I can do.

- [ ] Screenshot current buffer (of the game world, not with UI)
- [ ] Allow fade out

*** TODO Sepia filter.
Might need to figure out how to get this to blend properly with the grayscale filter
tr = 0.393R + 0.769G + 0.189B
tg = 0.349R + 0.686G + 0.168B
tb = 0.272R + 0.534G + 0.131B
*** TODO SDL2 Mixer Audio Backend.
This should be trivial, my audio system should have a very sane design.

*** TODO Adding gold!
*** TODO Combat System changes
:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2022-08-27 Sat 15:20]--[2022-08-27 Sat 15:24] =>  0:04
CLOCK: [2022-08-27 Sat 13:27]--[2022-08-27 Sat 15:04] =>  1:37
:END:
These are some more adjustments to the combat system core.

We don't have really many items right now,

I have some of the ability UI done which is very nice I guess. Going to level design later... So I can still get some work that isn't
engine work done.

- [ ] Entity selection with abilities (and highlighting obviously.)
- [ ] Confirmation of ability selection.
- [ ] Also turn investment! (For now I will do pure turn based (just set action points to 0 after each action.))
- [ ] Add the usage of abilities
  I haven't quite figured out the uh, animation problem. Since there
  may be many complexities in the animation. Now anyway this is done
  I have to encode the animations as commands, and that might override
  lots of state. We're not doing that right now.

  We're just going to focus on getting the ability infrastructure to
  work without animations.

  I suspect the animations aren't going to be too difficult to do though.
*** TODO Combat Animations
- [ ] Ability animation structure
- [ ] Add standard attack animations
  While this technically requires more art, we can animate a violent bump
  for now if we lack any animations otherwise (along with a damage flash).

  This isn't very difficult to do. It will also be the default animation
  if we lack any other type of animation.

*** TODO Getting the shop to actually work
We have the UI for the shop system (done last week), but we never actually got it's behavior to work as intended.

Also obviously, I want to animate stuff.
*** TODO Items from Files
Our item formats are probably going to be kept very simple. We're
going to try to constrain what we can and cannot do for the sake
of avoiding scope-creep.

Chrono Trigger in many ways was both a simple and complicated game. Simple
in it's mechanics, complicated with it's execution.

Items don't need to be able to do literally everything. If they need to
do more impressive things, we will handle that when the time comes however
we need to basically only assume a few basica archetypes of items.

*** TODO Entities will drop items at the end of battle
*** TODO Parameter adjustable Postprocessing
*** TODO Lighting
We're doing a simple sprite per pixel lighting system. It will likely not obey obstructions to start, but that's okay for now.
*** TODO Level Up Curve
*** TODO ambient affectors (birds, light shafts, clouds, fog)
These are minor, but easy things to program so the game looks less dumb.

Might not do birds, probably just keeping clouds and fog.
*** TODO Sprite Props/Objects (Generally these are custom scripted objects within the engine. Fun.)
These things don't have to obey tile lock limitations but they can snap to the grid if needed. They are also separated
into layers. These things will be done later, not necessarily needed.
*** TODO Level planning,
*** TODO More scenario writing
*** TODO Entities defined from files
*** TODO initial save record work
After most of this we should be in good enough shape to start doing the save system as that would constitute most of the game mechanics.
** Friday
*** Story Writing!
I'm going to mainly be trying to come up with a reasonable script for Act1's intro and middle point. That's going
to mostly be done at night or whatever free time I have.
** Saturday
** Sunday

* OLD TASK LIST. 
When I'm ready to work today:

Technically this isn't that much, and once this is done, we can get
to work on the story writing (for a week or so, until I have a passable script,
and then produce the game. We may have to revamp the pixel art, which is okay...
Although I want to keep this art for the Act 1 Demo. Possibly for the whole release
but who knows...)

Anyways I've learned, making game tools is extremely important. Also I need to
make tools to make the majority of work extremely convenient.

Most of Wednesday expected work
  
Extra time or the next avaliable work day.
- NPCs from Files
- Allow arbitrary scripts to be associated with a level, to make things easier to test within the editor.
- Allow single command entering (for faster debugging and level testing...)
- Create a scenario (writing.)

Do this stuff (some of it)

Art is most likely to be done on the weekend.

- SDL2 Mixer Audio

- Master Tileset from a file. Want to avoid compiling too much.

- Setup the save record system for save states.

- Check the game variable system to see if it works.

- Particle System (later)
- Lighting (later)


- Maybe find a few days to make some pixel art

- for myself, since I kind of need it... Aligning pixel
  art is going to be a bit of a bitch but, I don't have the tooling
  to facilitate any of it.
- Okay, I do need a testing tileset. Need to draw that today

Open for business on Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, maybe sunday
