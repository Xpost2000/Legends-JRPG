Okay I'll just erase this at the end of each session and write new stuff
into it everytime.

Right now I am:

This is going to be quite a bit of work.

** Maybe consider fixing the editor UI for tiles????
** Improve the dialogue UI
** More focused dialogue? Focus on a specific entity
** Nine Patch UI implementation
   Use it to make stuff nicer
** Setting up a main menu structure.
   The main menu will have a function new game and load game
   button.

   We will have that much.

   I want this to look nicer and more complete :)
** Intro Storyboard.
   Black screen / faded black screen storyboard with image behind?
   Anyways this is going to be used for now.
** Setting up Combat Infrastructure.
   Allow entering combat, with aggroed enemies (not too many setups right now)

   And setup the basic combat UI as well as the turn based part.

   The AI doesn't need to be implemented for a little while.

** Weapon and Armor item types
