# Legends RPG: Code Samples

As Legends is a fairly large project for a solo developer who's also
currently a full-time student. A lot of things can change over the course
of a year.

Here are some selected samples from the engine/game code that are balanced
between a level of interest and being well written.

This also happens to double as documentation for some select parts of the engine.

- ![Input system](./input_system.md)
- ![Multithreaded job system](./job_system.md)
- ![Serialization system](./serialization.md)
- ![Save system excerpt](./save_system_excerpt.md)
