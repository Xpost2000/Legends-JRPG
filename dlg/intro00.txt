# Experimental DSL for the games' dialogue system.
# needs to support actions and conditionals

# The thing is this is practically a lisp.

# attempting grammar
# (START) => (ACTIONS) (this is to allow you to setup scenes)
# NAME (game-focus-target-id)? : (string dialogue) => (ACTIONS)

# (ACTIONS) is meant to basically be a lisp form to be evaluated
# (START) => (GOTO 0) If we don't find one of these somewhere, always start at the first node
