# Experimental DSL for the games' dialogue system.
# needs to support actions and conditionals

# The thing is this is practically a lisp.

# attempting grammar
# (START) => (ACTIONS) (this is to allow you to setup scenes)
# NAME (game-focus-target-id)? : (string dialogue) => (ACTIONS)

# (ACTIONS) is meant to basically be a lisp form to be evaluated
# (START) => (GOTO 0) If we don't find one of these somewhere, always start at the first node

"Griggs" : "Don't know where you get off being so poety, and stuff."
"Griggs" : "Anyway, you ready to ditch this spot?"
"Byron" : "Uh, [(delay_timer 0.4)] not quite yet. [(delay_timer 0.6)] I owe the village elder a favor."
"Byron" : "I'll get you later."
"Griggs" : "Alright, I'll wait at the inn."
