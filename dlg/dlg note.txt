To avoid changing the data structure I currently have too much,
I'm probably just going to "preprocess" the dialogue files since the problem I have with augmenting
the data structure is to account for the permutations of the tree.

However the permutations are generally fixed on entering the dialogue so, a lot of permutations can basically
be "optimized out", mostly anything involving conditionals. Even random chance can be permutated out since we just
roll all the die at dialogue load. It's basically the same.

It causes more parsing work, however it makes the runtime code very simple.

I'm writing this here incase I forget this. Although it's very likely I myself may never read this file.
