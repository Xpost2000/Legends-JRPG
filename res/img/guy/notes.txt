This is the template guy image,

anyways I might need a bit of sprite padding to build some more
spunk into the animation.

Animations should be easily queriable by the engine, and should just be loaded
as flat pngs. Though we might hit my graphics assets texture limit and I might
need to build texture atlases to load.

If we don't have an animation just load the walk animation as it is an animation
we can "animate" for placeholders.
