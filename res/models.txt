# all the animations are implicitly found by path
# I'm planning to control animation manually during cutscenes
# if it's needed so I'm not going to rely on timing for those.
# timing is used for automatic game animations though.

# IE: abilities and cutscenes are never going to use the fixed animation
# timings here. (unless they're part of a pre-established command)
